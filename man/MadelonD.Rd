\description{
Madelon is a synthetic data set from the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge, generated by Isabelle Guyon.
It contains 480 irrelevant and 20 relevant features, including 5 informative and 15 redundant.
In this version, the originally numerical attributes have been pre-discetised into 10 bins, as well as their names have been altered to reveal 20 relevant features (as identified by the Boruta method).
