Changes in 5.0:
 - JIM algorithm as an alternative version of JMI which
 is using Gini impurity instead of information gain.
 - Gini impurity feature scorer.
 - Fixed instability in breaking ties between equivalent
 features in multi-threaded case. Now, feature of a lowest
 index is always returned.

Changes in 4.1:
 - Fixed code used to auto-cut numerical values into
 bins; maximal value used to be wrapped to the minimal bin,
 which was substantially altering results.

Changes in 4.0:
 - MI, CMI, JMI and NJMI feature scorers.
 - Parallelism is now controlled by threads argument.
 - Documentation improvements.
 - Fixed MIM handing of many features with zero score; thanks 
 to smilesun for spotting this.

Changes in 3.0:
 - Installation possible without OpenMP support.
 - Fixed segfault in NJMIM/JMIM for certain, specific inputs.
 - Faster internal hash table.
 - Faster CMIM/NJMIM/JMIM due to Fleuret's algorithm.
 - New output format.

Changes in 2.0:
 - OpenMP parallelism in all praznik functions.
 - Fixed segfault for constant numerical features. Thanks to 
 alecuba16 for spotting this.

Changes in 1.0:
 - First public release.
